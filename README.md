# GUI Layouts

## Due: Mon 4/24 at 11:59 PM

- Copy your code from `GuiPizza.java`
- Make your GUI look visually appealing using at least 3 separate layout managers of at least 2 different types
  - You choose which layout managers you think will work best
- You should not be making any changes to the "brains" of the program, just the structure
- When you are done, uncomment the print statement in `Done.java`
