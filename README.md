# GUI Layouts

- Copy your code from `GuiPizza.java`
- Make your GUI look visually appealing using at least 3 separate layout managers
  - You choose which layout managers you think will work best
- You should not be making any changes to the "brains" of the program, just the structure
- When you are done, uncomment the print statement in `Done.java`
